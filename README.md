This repositiory provides the source code for "Wide and Deep Learning for Automatic Cell Type Identification". 

Two datasets (Chang and Tirosh) are included that contain roughly 2000 patients with the 1000 most variable genes from the Chang dataset. The script 'script/script_3_1.py' contains the data processing procedure, construction of four models (1. No Regularixation (Nothing), 2. 20% Dropout (Dropout only), 3. 20% dropout and l1 kernel regularization (Dropout + l1), and 4. 20% dropout and l2 kernel regularization (Dropout + l2)), and the computation and comparision of the most important weights in each model. The script 'script/3.2' contains the data processing, construction of the naive and wide and deep learning models in a variety of setting (channging the location of the wide component, and swapping the training), and comparison of the model weights.
